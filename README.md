## Introduction
The Image Encryption Using RSA project aims to enhance the security of images by applying encryption techniques. Encryption is performed at the pixel level to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of the image data. By using the RSA algorithm, the project provides a robust and secure method for encrypting images.

## RSA Algorithm
The project implements the RSA algorithm from scratch. RSA is a widely used asymmetric encryption algorithm that relies on the use of a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption. The RSA algorithm ensures the confidentiality of the encrypted data and allows for secure communication.

## Image Encryption
The image encryption process involves encrypting each pixel of the image using the RSA algorithm. The pixel values are transformed using the public key, ensuring that the encrypted image data is protected. The encrypted image is then saved as a shareable text file, which can be securely stored or transmitted.
